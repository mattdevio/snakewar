## Directions
Your basic snake game, only PvP. The stage wraps around. You die by running into the other snake or your own body.


## Developer Notes
This was designed as a personal project for one of my development classes. It went well, however there are some major flaws. The project works well if played on LAN, but does not respond well to lag.

I didn't know much about game server development at the time. Lacks client side predicition. The tick rate is too high, the game event loop is a bit bulky, etc. Would like to go back and fix it one day. For now it is a dead project.
